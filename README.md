## About Me
Hey there!

I'm an MS(R) student at IIT Delhi, in the Department of Electrical Engineering, specializing in Analog Integrated Circuits, advised by Prof Kaushik Saha and Prof Mukul Sarkar for my research work. I completed my BTech from IIT Delhi (2021-25).

**Research Project:**
Currently, I am working on a boost converter design *devoid of the inductor*, aimed at on-chip fabrication and use in VLSI circuits. Traditional inductors are bulky and challenging for on-chip fabrication. While gyrators (with active elements) can mimic inductors for small-signal AC, large-signal and DC solutions remain an open problem. Capacitor-based charge pumps are a developed approach in the discrete-time domain, but with generally low efficiency.
